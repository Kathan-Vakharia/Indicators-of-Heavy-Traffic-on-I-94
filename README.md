#  Abstract

In this project, we are going to analyse the dataset about the westbound traffic on the **I-94 Interstate Highway**.

The goal of our analysis is to determine a few **indicators** of heavy traffic on **I-94**. These indicators can be weather type, time of the day, time of the week, etc.
